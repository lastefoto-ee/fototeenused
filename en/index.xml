&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Children grow fast and learn new skills every day. Shaking hands, sitting up, toothless smiles and first steps. These memories will be priceless for both you and your child in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it is advisable to book a baby photo shoot in advance.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>babies from the age of 4 months who hold their head well, are happy to lie on their tummy or who sit without support are welcome to have a baby photo shoot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>please bring snacks and familiar toys for babies to help catch their attention if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we will always do our best to make your baby smile in the photos, but be aware that even babies who laugh a lot at home can be more serious in the studio.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>for babies up to 1 year old (both boys and girls) we have cute dresses, bodysuits, shirts, pants, sweaters, etc. that can be worn during the photo shoot. For a family shoots, it is recommended to use a t-shirt /blouse/dress (for a mother) in a neutral (e.g. white, grey or black) or rich colour. Avoid long sleeves and patterns/lettering on the clothes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>during the shoot, parents are also responsible for older siblings who are in the studio.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Schedule your Cake Smash photo shoot keeping naps and bedtime in mind&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When planning a cake smash photo shoot, keep bedtime in mind. The goal of cake smash photo shoot is to capture your baby&amp;rsquo;s personality, so we want to make sure they are well rested. If your baby is on a schedule and takes naps at the same time every day, I will work around that schedule. If your baby is not on a schedule but is happiest at certain times of the day, please schedule the session during that time.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Let your baby be a little hungry&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Although I usually advise feeding your child before a session to prevent them from being starving and grumpy, it can occasionally be helpful for cake smash photo shoot if your child is just a little bit hungry. Of course, continue to feed them, but if they are a little bit hungry when you bring them to the shoot, they may be more likely to eat the cake. When they see the cake after having just finished a full meal, they might not be as willing and ready to eat more.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Bring baby&amp;rsquo;s favorite snack&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Have your baby&amp;rsquo;s favorite food on hand if you are concerned that your child won&amp;rsquo;t eat the cake right away. Whatever their &amp;ldquo;always makes them happy&amp;rdquo; food is — bring those with you. We can hide those little snacks in the icing or part of the cake to encourage them to really dig into that cake.&lt;/p>
